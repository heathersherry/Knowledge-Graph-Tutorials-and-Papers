__Clustering Methods Used for Canonicalization__
Note: So far most of the papers I read employ HAC for canonicalization for two major reasons: (1) no predefined number of clusters, (2) Un-sensitive to similarity metrics. The standard algorithm for hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) has a time complexity of O(n^3) and requires O(n^2) memory.
1. An efficient algorithm for a complete link method. Comput. J. 20, 4 (1977), complete linkage, O(n^2)
2. A Hierarchical Algorithm for Extreme Clustering (KDD 2017), approximate Hierarchical clustering algorithms at the cost of some loss in performance.
3. SLINK: an optimally efficient algorithm for the single-link cluster method, O(n^2)
