# KG and LLM
```
**My personal thoughts**:
1. As a data representation, graph structure is fundamentally an intuitive modeling approach that aligns with human cognition.
Nevertheless, it may not necessarily be scientifically optimal for modeling all types of world knowledge, especially when
compared with LLM which captures complex distributions through neural networks.
2. KGs, however, offer verified factual accuracy (primarily curated through crowdsourcing and human validation), thereby
avoiding the hallucination issues inherent in LLMs.
3. In the era of LLMs, these research directions may be more insightful.
(1) leveraging pre-existing high-precision knowledge graphs to enhance post-training and
fine-tuning of LLMs (particularly domain-specific LLMs) by integrating structured knowledge into their data preparation pipeline.
(2) leveraging pre-existing high-precision knowledge graphs to enhance the quality of inference, either by RAG or prompting.

> My thoughts!:
> * This may be different from multi-modal RAG, where the context is in multiple modalities (e.g., image, text, video, ...) represented as embedding, and the query is based on fuzzy serach in vector db. If we need to query the knowledge in KGs, we need to rely on other query engine, such as SPAEQL on graphs.
> * Graph RAG/KAG may be more valuable in domain-specific area.
> * However, although the evaluation results on research benchmarks of multi-hop QA proves that KAG works, I am still wondering whether KAG really works in real-world scenarios, since building accurate domain-specific KG is very costly. Purely employing the exisiting information extraction methods (e.g., various tools for OpenIE) cannot output a KG with 100% correct and reliable knowledge, which may lead to hallusiciasion as well. Maybe the KAG work (Arxiv 2024) is a good example to start this research, since it successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&A tasks of the industrial downstream tasks in the Ant Group.
> * The keypoint of Graph RAG/KAG should be **the wiseful integration** of the benefits of unstructured information and structured information.

> * KGs can be employed to address the hallusiasion in LLMs. Howevers, KGs may be (1) incomplete, or (2) knowledge inconsistant while applied with information extraction techniques. LLM helps to address this two issues. Therefore, a CogMG framework is proposed for the collaborative augmentation between LLM and KGs.
