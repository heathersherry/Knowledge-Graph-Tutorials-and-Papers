## Knowledge Graphs in Agent Memory (people may use "Memory Graph" instead of "Knowledge Graph")
```
Personally, there are a few keypoints that memory graph should focus on:
1. The freshness of the graph, since people's interest changes from time to time (also considered by Mem0-g and Graphiti),
2. The correctness of the entity extraction for memory, especially in multi-modal scenarios when users may use less words as instructions.
We can only guess the preference of users based on the acceptance rates of the model output such as video/figure generation.
3. The correctness of the entity matching, or the dicision of whether using the matched memory entities or not in a new scenario.
```

> * Memary uses a graph database to store knoweldge.
> * Llama Index was used to add nodes into the graph store based on documents.
> * Perplexity (mistral-7b-instruct model) was used for external queries.
2. **ZEP**: A TEMPORAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH ARCHITECTURE FOR AGENT MEMORY (ZepAI, Arxiv 2025) [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13956)] ðŸ”¥ HOT!
> * Zep implements three search functions: cosine semantic similarity search (Ï•cos), Okapi BM25 full-text search (Ï•bm25), and breadth-first search (Ï•bfs). The first two functions utilize Neo4jâ€™s implementation of Lucene.

> *  Retrieval from the AriGraph memory consists of two procedures: (1) a semantic search returns the most relevant triplets (semantic edges) and (2) an episodic search that, given extracted triplets, returns the most relevant episodic vertices
