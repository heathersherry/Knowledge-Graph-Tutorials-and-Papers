The reranking model can then use more sophisticated features for collective classification over this pruned set.

> * Incorporate the unlinkable mention prediction process into the entity ranking process. They added a NIL entity into the candidate entity set, and considered NIL as a distinct candidate.
10. A generative entity-mention model for linking entities with knowledge base (ACL 2011)
> * The model assumes that for the entity mention which refers to some specific entity, the probability of this entity mention generated by this specific entity’s model should be significantly higher than the probability of this mention generated by a general language model. 
11. No Noun Phrase Left Behind: Detecting and Typing Unlinkable Entities (EMNLP-CoNLL ’12)
> * Train a classifier with features primarily derived from a timestamped corpus.
