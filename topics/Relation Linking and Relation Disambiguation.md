### Linking and Disambiguation of Relational Phrases

__Relation Linking__
1. Matching natural language relations to knowledge graph properties for question answering (ReMatch, SEMANTICS 2017)
2. Capturing knowledge in semantically-typed relational patterns to enhance relation linking (SIBKB, K-CAP 2017)
