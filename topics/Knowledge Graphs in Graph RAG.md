## Knowledge Graphs in RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

```
Note: The definition of KGs may be different in each RAG work. Usually there are 3 types of KGs.
1. Eentity-level KG, while each node represents an entitiy or a concept, and each link represents the semantic relation or self-defined relation between a pair of nodes (e.g., whether they are extracted from the same document). `fine-grained`
2. Metadata-level KG, while each node represents the metadata of a document chunk (e.g., the topic or description of the document chunk), and each link represents self-defined relation between a pair of nodes (e.g., the correlation bewteen the topics). `middle-grained`
3. Document chunk-level KG, while each node represents a document chunk, and each link represents the context sequence of the nodes. `coarse-grained` 
* This is aligned with the of LLM+KG inference:
> Compared with neural networks the captures complex distribution of knowledge, graphs of entities may not be scientifically optimal as a knowledge model.
> But graphs can record the connection among document chunks or the tapologies of entity concepts, to facilitate the *retrieval sequence* of llm inference. 
```

> My thoughts!:
> * This may be different from multi-modal RAG, where the context is in multiple modalities (e.g., image, text, video, ...) represented as embedding, and the query is based on fuzzy serach in vector db. If we need to query the knowledge in KGs, we need to rely on other query engine, such as SPAEQL on graphs.
> * Graph RAG/KAG may be more valuable in domain-specific area.
> * However, although the evaluation results on research benchmarks of multi-hop QA proves that KAG works, I am still wondering whether KAG really works in real-world scenarios, since building accurate domain-specific KG is very costly. Purely employing the exisiting information extraction methods (e.g., various tools for OpenIE) cannot output a KG with 100% correct and reliable knowledge, which may lead to hallusiciasion as well. Maybe the KAG work (Arxiv 2024) is a good example to start this research, since it successfully applied KAG to two professional knowledge Q&A tasks of the industrial downstream tasks in the Ant Group.
> * The keypoint of Graph RAG/KAG should be **the wiseful integration** of the benefits of unstructured information and structured information.

### KG-RAG, or GraphRAG
```
Based on the granularity of KGs, we classify the Graph RAG works into the following two types.
1. Works that use Coarse-grained KG
* These works first construct a KG based on input documents, then query or summerize on the KG. They usually require KG construction.
* Note: The definitions of nodes and edges of "KG" vary in different works. The nodes may be entities, nouns, document metadata, or document chunk summary; while the edges may be the semantic relations bewteen the nodes, or self-defined relations such as "co-occurrence in the same document chunk" or "appeared in the same document".
2. Works that use Fine-grained KG
* These works conduct query or reasoning on predifinded graph (usually as input). They do not require KG construction.

> * Advanced: **LazyGraphRAG**, which defers LLM use (not in the extraction part, but only in the query part) and dramatically increase the efficiency of answer generation.
