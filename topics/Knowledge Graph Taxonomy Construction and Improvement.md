#### The Palantir Ontology
* It seems that the concept of Ontology in Palantir is quite popular nowadays.
* However, there are critical differences between the Palantir Ontology and the ontology in general KGs.
> * The key point of Palantir Ontology is to link the dynamic data from external data sources (e.g., Spark or Flink tables), which facilitates the investigation in militaries and financial areas where information updates frequently.
> * The key point of ontology in general KGs is to provide well-defined schema or classfication for the triples, entities and relations stored in KG. Compared with the "Ontology Graph" in Palantir, the general KG is more like a static "snapshot" of knowledge.
