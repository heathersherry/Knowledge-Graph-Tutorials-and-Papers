## Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA)
Note: This task is highly related with the following topics:
* [Entity Linking and Disambiguation](https://github.com/heathersherry/Knowledge-Graph-Tutorials-and-Papers/blob/master/topics/Entity%20Linking%20and%20Entity%20Disambiguation.md), which recognizes the target entities in the question.
* [Relation Linking and Disambiguation](https://github.com/heathersherry/Knowledge-Graph-Tutorials-and-Papers/blob/master/topics/Relation%20Linking%20and%20Relation%20Disambiguation.md), which recognizes the target predicates in the question.
* [Knowledge Graph Embedding and Reasoning](https://github.com/heathersherry/Knowledge-Graph-Tutorials-and-Papers/blob/master/topics/Knowledge%20Graph%20Embedding%2C%20Learning%2C%20Reasoning%2C%20Rule%20Mining%2C%20and%20Path%20Finding.md), which discovers hidden relations among entities in the KG and hence often relies on KGQA for evaluation.

>   Three challenges in KBQA systems: (1) Complex query handling; (2) Resource scarcity for semantic parsing; (3) Underutilization of large language models
(LLMs).
>   The proposed Interactive-KBQA framework conceptualizes the LLM as an agent and the KB as the environment (See Fig 1 in the paper, Thought-Action-Observation). Given a complex query, the LLM is required to think and provide an action to interact with the KB through a set of specific tools. These tools return the execution results as observations.
